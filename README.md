Doodle
====================

![Comparison](./comp.png)


Doodle is a project that approximates a source image using semitransparent circles of different sizes and colors.
The project implements two optimizers: one using a genetic algorithm, and another based on simulated annealing.

The project was implemented as a learning exercise with correctness as the primary goal. As a result, the performance is far from optimal.
